In general, they are making this data publicly available for broad, noncommercial public use, including by medical and public health researchers, policymakers, analysts and local news media (which is why you're probably here at this repository).

If you use this data, you must attribute it to “The New York Times” in any publication.

Check out the NYT LICENSE for the full terms of use for this data. I simply wrote some other ways to visualize it and incorporate some data from VERAS.
